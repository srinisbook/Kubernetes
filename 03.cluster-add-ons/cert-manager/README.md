# cert-manager

cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate TLS certificates management and issuance from various issuing sources such as Let’s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, a simple signing keypair, or self signed.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates  before expiry.

Documentation for cert-manager can be found at [docs.cert-manager.io](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/ "docs.cert-manager.io")

## Install cert-manager

    $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.yaml

### Helm chart

#### Add cert manager Helm repository

helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --version v1.7.1 \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

Uninstalling the Chart

# Issuers

Issuers (and ClusterIssuers) represent a certificate authority from which signed x509 certificates can be obtained, such as Let’s Encrypt. 

You will need at least one Issuer or ClusterIssuer in order to begin issuing certificates within your cluster.

- An Issuer is a namespaced resource, you will need to create an Issuer in each namespace you wish to obtain Certificates in.

- If you want to create a single issuer that can be consumed in multiple namespaces, you should consider creating a ClusterIssuer resource.



# Let's Encrypt

<img src="https://dyltqmyl993wv.cloudfront.net/assets/stacks/cert-manager/img/cert-manager-stack-220x234.png" width="200" />

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority. Documentation can be found at [letsencrypt.org]( https://letsencrypt.org/docs/)

Currently, letsencrypt providing following API endpoints:
- [Production] https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
- [Staging] https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

It is recommend testing against staging before using production environment. This will allow you to get things right before issuing trusted certificates and reduce the chance of your running up against rate limits.

See [Rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/)

#### Create Issuer (or ClusterIssuer)

Edit the issuer manifest and add your working email address. It is used for ACME registration.

      acme:
        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        email: 'your-name@domain.com'

Create letsencrypt staging for testing and switch over to letsencrypt production server once your application worked as expected.

    $ kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer-stage.yaml
                    --  or --
    $ kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer-prod.yaml

List all cluster-issuers

    $ kubectl get clusterissuers
    NAME                  AGE
    letsencrypt-prod      1d
    letsencrypt-stage     1d

#### Ingress object annotation

You must add an annotation in the ingress configuration with issuer or clusterissuer name.

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: frontend-ingress
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
       #certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - app.mydomain.com
        secretName: app-mydomain-com
      rules:
      - host: app.mydomain.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: frontend
              servicePort: 8080      

Once the ingress created, there should be a tls secret and certifcate created.

    $ kubectl get secrets
    NAME                TYPE               DATA   AGE
    app-mydomain-com    kubernetes.io/tls  3      1d
    
    $ kubectl get certificates
    NAME                READY   SECRET            AGE
    app-mydomain-com    True    app-mydomain-com  1d

If you found that the certificate or secret not created, then check the logs of the cert-manger service for errors.

> Note: If you use letsencrypt staging, you will see conection is not secure in the browser. You will see connection is secure when you use letsencrypt production issuer.
